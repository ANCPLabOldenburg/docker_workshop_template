# Welcome!

Hello everyone and welcome to the "Docker for Neuroscience" workshop conducted at Oldenburg University, we're glad to see you here!

Within these pages, we provide information on how to follow do the basic setup for the workshop, This [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) will include all necessary info. Simply follow this link --- 

You can navigate through the respective sections via the TOC on the left side and within sections via the TOC on the right side. The three symbols in the top allow to enable full screen mode, link to the underlying [Github repository](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/docker_workshop) and allow you to download the contents as a pdf or jupyter notebook respectively. Some sections will additionally have a little rocket in that row which will allow you to interactively rerun certain analyses via cloud computing. Additionally, we support public reviews and comments through an [hypothes.is plugin](https://web.hypothes.is/) with which you can interact on the right side. All of this awesomeness (talking about the infrastructure and resource) is possible through the dedicated and second to none work of the [Jupyter community](https://jupyter.org/community), specifically, the [Executable/Jupyter Book](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/).
